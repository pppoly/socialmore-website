# Hero Asset Placeholders

The production build expects the following hero visuals to be placed in this folder before deployment:

- `hero-main.jpg` – final photographic hero background (approx. 1920x1080) with brand gradient lighting.
- `hero-overlay-shapes.svg` – translucent abstract line artwork layered over the hero section.
- `hero-cta-arrow.svg` – optional CTA accent arrow.

These placeholders document the required filenames so GitHub Pages deployments under `/socialmore-website/` can resolve them once the design team uploads the real assets. Keep files optimized (<500KB) and avoid committing binaries to this repository.
